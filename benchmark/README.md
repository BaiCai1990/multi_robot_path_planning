# Path Planning Benchmark

## Execution

First, make sure you are in the benchmark package.
The benchmark can be executed via:
```
bash ./scripts/benchmark.sh
```
The framework can be closed by typing:
```
bash ./scripts/kill.sh
```
This process can be highly accelerated by creating system keyboard shortcuts like:
```
gnome-terminal -- bash <FULL_PATH>/benchmark.sh
gnome-terminal -- bash <FULL_PATH>/kill.sh
```
